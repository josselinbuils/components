# Getting Started

## Installation

```bash
yarn add @josselinbuils/components
npm install @josselinbuils/components --save
```

## Usage

```jsx
import { Alert } from '@josselinbuils/components/Alert';

<Alert level="info">This is an info alert</Alert>
```

Not to create unnecessary big bundles, the lib is provided with esnext syntax
and has to be transpiled using Babel or any similar tool to become compatible
with older browsers.
